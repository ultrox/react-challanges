## Motivation

This is CoderByte challenge "React Phone Book" labeled as `Medium`
[here](https://coderbyte.com/challenges)

Mainly I wanted to play around with idea of not using the react state for
simple forms but use native HTML5 support to get the data and reset the form.

## Specification

- Build Phonebook where you can add person with First & Last Name, Phone & 
  Address.
* Represent the person data in table (use table) element
* Make the column sortable when you click on `Th`

## Stack
- React
- Styled component
* tooling
  * prettier
  * husky
  * lintstaged
  * eslint
  * CI/CD with circle ci

Deployed with netlify [here](https://staging-pb.netlify.com/)

## PS 

For whatever reason I enjoy using codepen.com [here][codepen-example] for 
working with HTML & css, so I do it there, then I convert it to Jsx with styled 
component.
